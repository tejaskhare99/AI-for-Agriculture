# AI-for-Agriculture
## A research to propose a solution for a common problem faced by farmers across the world.

The problem in a nutshell - Trespassing of wild animals over the crop fields 
Proposed Solution - Using object detection and a novel algorithm to prevent the trespassing with high cost efficiency in the long run

***Abstract*** 

Artificial Intelligence is everywhere today. But unfortunately, Agriculture has not been able to get that much attention from Artificial Intelligence (AI). A lack of automation persists in the agriculture industry. For over many years, farmers and crop field owners have been facing the problem of trespassing of wild animals for which no feasible solution has been provided. Installing a fence or barrier like structure is neither feasible nor efficient due to the large areas covered by the fields. Also, if the landowner can afford to build a wall or barrier, government policies for building walls are often very irksome. The paper intends to give a simple intelligible solution to the problem with Automated Crop Field Surveillance using Computer Vision. The solution will significantly reduce the cost of crops destroyed annually and completely automate the security of the field.
